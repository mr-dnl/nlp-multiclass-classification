# POC - Automatic Classification Of Textual Occurrences

This project aims to manipulate textual information for various categorical classifications.

Problem: Many occurrences are not answered because the RPA system, in some cases, is not able to capture all 
the information necessary for the classification when the call is opened to be answered. 
Thus, the SLA ends up being compromised and customers are not served, thus causing many problems for the service team.

Solution: Creation of a POC to classify the occurrences opened by the RPA system, that did not have all data 
necessary completed filled out.
